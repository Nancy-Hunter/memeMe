## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, Appwrite, and Vite

Database scrubbed from ImgFlip API and input into Appwrite Database. Filters user responses to return a customized response from the database. 

## Optimizations

Increasing the size of the database to include null responses would create more flexibility for the user. Ideally I would like to make the return sharable.
